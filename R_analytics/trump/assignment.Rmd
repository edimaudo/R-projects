## Assignment
Objective is to find out who Trump voters are and what sets them apart

## Load Packages
```{r echo=TRUE}
packages <- c('ggplot2', 'corrplot','tidyverse','dplyr','plyr','MASS','readxl',
              'NbClust','scales','psy','factoextra','nFactors','GoodmanKruskal',
              'gridExtra','grid','caret','mlbench')
for (package in packages) {
  if (!require(package, character.only=T, quietly=T)) {
    install.packages(package)
    library(package, character.only=T)
  }
}
```

## Load data
```{r}
df <- read_excel("Data.xlsx", sheet = "data")
```

## Data summary
```{r}
summary(df)
```

```{r}
# check for missing variables
missing_data <- apply(df, 2, function(x) any(is.na(x)))
print(missing_data)
```







```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
