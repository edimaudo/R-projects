Operations Research Model
My project revolves around optimizing an AFL fantasy football team, using a player's 2017 scores, and adhering to certain constraints.  My Objective Function: Maximize my team's season score, which is the score from Week/Round 1 all the way through to Week 23. 
Bound to the following Constraints: 
1. Pick 30 players out of a possible 652 players. 
2. Pick players from different positions, such that there are 8 DEFs, 10 MIDs, 4 RUCs, and 8 FWDs. Some players can play more than one position. 
3. Understand that only 22 out of the 30 players are on the 'field' 
 - meaning their scores count towards the weekly team score. The remaining 8 players are on the 'bench', who's score doesn't count. The field positions are: 6 DEFs, 8 MIDs, 2 RUCs, 6 FWDs. The bench positions are: 2 DEFs, 2 MIDs, 2 RUCs, 2 FWDs. 
 4. Each player has a price. The total cost of all 30 players must be less than or equal to the starting budget of $12.6mil. 
 5. Each week, I only get 2/3 trades (2 most weeks, 3 over designated rounds). 
 Therefore, out of the 30 players in the current week's team, at minimum 27/28 players should be the exact same as the previous week. Furthermore, each trade should adhere to my remaining salary cap budget from week to week.
