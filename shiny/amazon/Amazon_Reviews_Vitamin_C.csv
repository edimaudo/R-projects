After buying it I realized that I had bought this one in the past and after just taking it once I threw away the bottle because it made me feel so sick, but I thought well now I have the entire bottle, I have been taking it for many years, my tolerance might be higher and I will just take it with a lot of food. Well today I took my second one of these and I feel awful, my acid reflux is fared up, my stomach is burning, hurting, I am burping non stop, it is awful. I didn't even come on here to give a bad review I came to look at the engridients because how can this one be so much different then any other vitamin C only to find out that every post that has this specific brand has no ingredients listed, I guess they don't want peopl to know, will have to look at the bottle and hope that gives me some clue as to what could be causing this ill feeling. My stomach sounds and feels like it's fighting a war in there so I am definitly neveer buying this brand ever again. No thank you.UPDATE: Four days later and I am still not feeling well from taking this supplement and as I recall the same thing happened last time I took this brand. I am a healthy female in my 30s, I have made sure not to take any other supplement or do or eat anything different since I took this product so I know these symptoms are from this product. I am nauseous and the acid reflux is burning at my stomach like wildfire.

I use them to treat BV (I insert 1/2 pill into the VJJ weekly). I've been reading dozens of articles about how they change the pH down there, and eradicate BV.  As a 40 years sufferer of BV (during which time, Drs. misdiagnosed it 99% of the time), I was willing to try anything.  And voila...first time in 40 years, I am symptom free, after ONE day.  It's the cheapest miracle on earth.  BTW, others who use it for the same reason, insert 500 mg nightly for a few nights, but that dosage caused pretty significant burning (both inside and out, and caused a rash on my inner thighs), so I cut the dosage to 1/2 pill weekly, and it works perfectly.  So, adjust your dose as you like.  And if you find it starts to burn, just take a bath and the burning stops immediately.  Chose this brand because it is contains no artificial color, flavor, sweetener, sugar, starch, lactose, milk, soy, gluten, wheat, yeast, fish or sodium.  By the way, repHresh also works wonders (same effect of lowering pH to a level where ""bad"" bacteria cannot live), but at 100x the cost.I know, it sounds weird, but Google BV and Vitamin C :-)",5,,,

Seniors such as ourselves are prone to have a greater reaction to the disease. For vitamin C, it was determined to take 2,000mg a day, or two tablets a day at 1,000mg a day. First complaint is that these gummies are only 250mg of Vitamin C. You'd have to take 8 a day to get 2,000mg of Vitamin C.Second complaint is that I'm pre-diabetic, and the gummies are covered with sugar. I really wish that we could have gotten these at 1,000mg and NO SUGAR on the gummies. Naturemade adheres to USP standards, which a lot of supplement companies don't do. But taking 250mg of Vitamin C is not sufficient, and a lot of pre- or diabetics will have a small spike in sugar even if it's a small one-- eating these gummies. I hope they work this out. Until then, we've found a gel capsule filled with 1,00mg solid vitamin C. I know gummies are more absorb-able. More supplement companies need to step up their game, and make them healthier and stronger.",3,,,

My gums itch/ache and my joints hurt.  I came back to the Kirkland brand and within a few days, my symptoms resolved.  I take one in the morning and at night.  If I'm catching a cold or trying to boost my immune system, I take 3-4 a day.  Your tolerance may be different.  There are 500 tablets in each jar.  After opening and closing over and over the air may oxidize the tablets. To avoid this - I only take out what I need in a month and keep in a sealed jar in the refrigerator. I also keep the original bottle tightly closed in the fridge. VitaminC products of any kind don't like warm, or humid storage.

Get it from the US store if you have someone traveling from the West any soon• If this fits your budget then definitely go for it. It works well.Well, that's about it. I hope this helps!",4,,,

I knew that too much vitamin C can cause diarrhea. It only took a couple of days to experience this 1st hand. Since these are capsules, to divide the dose, I am pouring out some very sour powder, guessing about the amount of 1/2 for a 500mg per day dose. Instead, I would recommend finding 300mg tablets and slowly increase the dose until you reach your ""threshold"". Trust me your body will tell you when it has had too much! Save these 1000mg capsules for your elephant.Lower doses more often makes more sense then one mega dose.

The fact that Doctors Best provides it at such a wonderfully inexpensive price with no added inactive ingredients ( flow agents, excipients, or binders) is just awesome.  So, if you want to stop reading here, just go buy it with some confidence that you're getting a great quality supplement at a wonderful price.In addition, it is such a delightful surprise to take a vitamin C supplement that doesn't give me some weird reaction after a few days.  I'm sure that I can't take this consistently (as I have to rotate everything on and off to avoid allergies  ), but I switched off a cheap China sourced ascorbic acid to this wonderful quality vitamin C and I have had absolutely no reaction.  (I've been using it for four days straight and I can honestly say I'm thrilled)  Thank you doctors best thank you Scotland!  ??",5,,,

And being a recurrent buyer of the product.I used another brand of Vitamin C and I switched 2 years ago to Doctor's Best Vitamin C (1000 mg). I felt somehow that the change was a key step to improve my health. I had a flu at least once a month and the usual residual cough that comes after the flu. Now, I have a minor flu once or twice every semester, and they last a maximum of a day and half and since it is a light flu I don't have residual cough anymore.After switching to Doctor's Best I also made some changes in my eating habits in order to avoid acid reflux (that I had from time to time), and that I believe was also sparking the flu. So perhaps the improve of health was a combination of chancing eating habits and trying a new brand of vitamin C.Whatever it was I am confident that changing the Vitamin C brand to Doctor's Best made a difference for good.",5,,,

First I like and recommend caps over tablets for most of the supplements I buy. I also like the ""Quali-C"" label as it indicates this brand goes an extra distance to ensure my satisfaction. Having said this, I can also state that I've not had any type of distress taking this cap: no pains, gas, burbles, gurgles, headache, etc...Good Question: Why do I take ""C"" at all?  Actually, ""C"" was the very 1st supplement that I began taking a lotta years ago. In my empirical experience, ""C"" has been a protector of my good health and too, when I felt a ""cold"" or some such thing coming-on, large amounts of ""C"" taken throughout the day would in many cases diminish or prevent the onset of whatever I was feeling. I have tested this so many times that I believe ""C"" works for me. Remember, ""C"" is water soluble and we will urinate(yellow)-out any unused. There have been many times when I have taken 6-8 caps a day and my urine was as clear as rainwater...so I conclude I was using it, especially that in most instances, whatever was coming on...didn't.  Your results may vary.",5,,,

Few years ago a neurosurgeon I saw tested me and concluded that I have migranal tendencies since childhood, which is why bright light on forehead, warm head bath and forceful wind on face give me headaches, as well as of course alcohol intake. I don't drink regularly, but whenever I used to drink more than two glasses of wine or more than half a pint of Whiskey/vodka/gin (in a mixed drink), I ALWAYS woke up early am with a massive hangover headache. However, since I started taking this supplement along with Magnesium just before going to bed after heavy drinking, I just stopped getting hangover headaches completely. And I no longer get headaches from wind and from warm headbaths also now. I have noticed this unexpected effect for four months now. I have no clue what the connection is, but it works for me and I will continue to take vitamin C & Magnesium for a long time to come.",5,,,

I personally rely on supplementing to keep off of all pharmaceuticals and over the counter medication and I absolutely do not want the government involved in regulating supplements – it won’t be regulating to get the bad supplements out to protect the public - it will be a way for the government to make a ton of money, they are the mob and they want their dues.

Yes, I was able to see a a small difference in reduced pimples over time (it’s still too early to tell about about my complexion). However with the influx of the Covid virus, taking 3000 IU, spread out with three meals, made a huge difference in staying healthy. I couldn’t maintain the recommendation of taking a pill before meals, especially first thing in the morning. I developed diarrhea, so I took it with food.

I don't know one person who ever had Scurvy. But whoever thought up that name deserves kudos for name invention. Good name for a  bad disease.  But lack of Vit C can certainly throw your health out of whack in many ways. When I'm  not lazy I make my own Lipo- C,  but admittedly I'm lazy when it comes to spending the 1/2  hr. minimum time required to make up a good batch. Meanwhile,  of all the Vitamin C  brand supplements out there,  this one definitely seems superior to me. It's almost like you can feel it. My wife is prone to colds and flu. Often on the verge. Too many daily temperature changes on her job plus heavy public contact. This has worked to ward off her ""coming down with something "" many a time. Regardless, I take one one in the morning  and one before bedtime. I know my supplements and this one is a step above the rest.  Strange though; Scottish Vit C. Who knew?

I've been doing mega doses of those Vitamin C, about 1000 mg per hour, just to keep myself from getting worse.So, today UPS shows up with my Now Foods Vitamin C.  I took one tablet about 3 hours ago and not only am I not getting worse, but I am getting better.  I can breathe through my nose and stuff has loosened up in my chest and burns a lot less.Vitamin C is not only a great anti-oxident, but has anti-inflamatory properties and anti-viral properties, which makes it the best thing to use when it comes to a cold.  Leave the chemicals alone, you can't hurt yourself with too much Vitamin C even if you do take too much, you're body will just expell what it doesn't need.I also use Now Foods Quercetin with Bromelain after doing research on asthma and asthma treatments and how harmful the meds are.  Since using Quercetin I haven't had an asthma attack that I've had to be hospitalized for since.  This use to happen 3 or 4 times a year prior, usually during the months when windows are closed.I believe Now Foods makes the highest quality products and foods too.

Although Liposomal C (mixed with oil/fat) is the most bio-available it's also way too expensive. There are many other types of C in the form of sodium ascorbates, but this is the best and least expensive. The main ""trick"" is to always take it with fat of some kind, i.e. butter, coconut oil, etc.I take one with breakfast and one with lunch along with my B complex and D3/K2, Fish Oil, and Probiotic.Ever since I was a kid I had a weak immune system (low white blood cell). Every year I'd get very sick 3-4 times a year with strep, swollen-glands, and the flu. My old doctor always tried to get me to take a flu shot and I never did, and I just dealt with getting sick. Now I have a holistic doctor and see a nutritionist - best decision of my life! I try to avoid inflammatory foods and take my vitamins.For the past three years, I have not gotten sick like I used to at all!  It's amazing! I will very rarely get a cold, and only if I am around someone who is deathly ill, but it will only last a couple days and is made much better by taking 4 tablets of C a day and drinking Tea with honey/lemon.This revelation is a life-changer! Do you know that they sometimes give cancer patients Vitamin C intravenously?If you want to know more about how to change your health and your life for the better, check out Dr. Mercola's website, see a certified nutritionist (covered by insurance), and  ditch your drug-dealing health ""practitioner"" for a holistic medical care professional (also covered by insurance).Side note: Almost every single American is low in D3 (abundant in grass-fed fats/organ meats)/K2 (abundant in dark leafy greens) and if you drink milk like I do, your Calcium levels are way too high (which also lowers D3/K2) and THAT is the reason for arterial calcification aka Hardening of the Arteries, and  Heart Disease (along with eating processed and fried foods that contain insane amounts of carcinogenic oxidized vegetable oils ). Vitamin K and D keep your calcium from leeching out of your bones, so if your high in Calcium and low in D3/K2, the calcium is literally pulled into your blood vessels. If you take statins, it's even worse!Best thing you can do is to know your numbers! Get a blood test and demand to know your vitamin and inflammation levels.",5,,,

Vitamin C,B0013P1GD6,United States ,April 18,April,2018,-,yes,Please consult your doctor prior to consumption of this substance.,"Hello Amazon Shoppers!I am a college student, musician, and clinician. I started taking vitamin C to boost my immune system like most would do until I suddenly became extremely ill. I threw up and began experiencing the worst pains of my life. As it turns out, this vitamin C most likely contributed to me developing a kidney stone. I looked into it and found out that excess salt in the diet and a high intake of vitamin C can lead to kidney stones. Of course, that's not all the science there is behind it; I do not remember the specifics but feel free to look them up, if desired. It saddens me to say this post is not fake because I am a healthy 21-year-old. Now, I can confirm that a 5-mile trip in an ambulance costs $1009.92 and the fact that ""basic life support,"" which in my case, consisted of kindly providing me with a blanket and laughing with myself as we joked about my pain, costs around $879. This, of course, has nothing to do with Amazon. Rather, it is an issue that can be resolved through actions made by pharmaceutical companies and government restrictions on what consumers are allowed to consume.Sincerely,A caring and concerned citizen",2,,,

They are large, but the flavor isn’t bad and goes right down with a gulp of water.  They appear to be high quality- I don’t know how to describe that but the pills are made and packaged well.  No crumbling or “dust”.  I use other supplements from this brand and they are all very well made and packaged.  A note of warning- I have chronic gastritis and these can occasionally trigger a flare up.  To avoid causing lots of problems I take one every other day.  I do hope my gastritis medication doesn’t interfere with absorption.

I have subsequently takes 500 or 1000 mg for about 30 years now and have had few and mild colds.  I realize that the scientific reserach on this topic does not support the conclusion that megadoses of C are effective against colds and obviously do not know what would have been the case if I had not taken such doses. Still, the cost in minimal and there are no side effects. I like this particular product because it is time-released and thus presumably will not just come out in my next urinaiton. I rate it at 3 stars, then, not because the product is not high quality, but rather because the evidence that it is effective against colds is far from supportive.

Take tons of vitamin C and also take Zinc. I followed this advice for a week and it worked. I am flu free, back to work and feeling great.

In big city life we all know we are not living like that everyday.I have started using this vitamin after I got sick with a immunity decreasing treatable disease and saw the outcome immediately. It is suggested to take ine pill a day (1000 mg) but I took two at start and saw no side effects but improving immunity.

Last year, I suffered through a nasty cold during the summer and vowed that it would not happen to me again this year.  I searched for homeopathic ways to prevent/combat common viruses (cold, influenza) and was amazed how often Vitamin C was mentioned.  Not only that, but it could cut the duration of cold/flu in HALF when taking megadoses of Vitamin C with few side effects!  That's as good as Tamiflu!  Without the horrible side effects.  The worst side effect I could find info on for Vitamin C overdose was diarrhea.  Seems pretty minor compared to the side effects of RX drugs.I want to be prepared if/when the next flu/cold outbreak hits and I feel confident that I am now.  I keep extra bottles in case I do become ill and will need to megadose every hour.If you don't believe me on the benefits, just Google ""Vitamin C cold flu megadose"" and read all about it.  I cannot believe I am just now learning all this and wanted to share this information.As for the NOW product, it was exactly as described and I have no complaints about the product.  As always, their supplements are superior.  I like the sustained release aspect of these tablets as well.  Be sure to take it with food, as it digests and absorbs better that way.  I am totally pleased :)",5,,,

I was also unable to safely drive myself to work that day.  It took almost 12 hours for the vertigo to abate.  I live alone, so this was a very scary experience!  I thought I was having a stroke or something similar.  Evidently something in this supplement interacted with one of my prescription meds.  This may be an inexpensive supplement, but it’s not so cheap when you end up throwing the rest of the bottle away.  I will never purchase anything with the Now brand on it again.

I fully realize it's my own fault for not reading more carefully, but DG posted a review about this in March of 2012, and states he was given a refund. Why is the faulty image still there?Unlike DG, I don't feel I was ""fooled"", as that would suggest purposeful deception on Amazon's part. Also, I wouldn't expect the product to prevent or treat a medical condition, and give a bad review if it didn't! It's merely a nutritional supplement!Unfortunately, I also stupidly ordered the wrong Vitamin E. I wanted it plain, not with Selenium. Now I have two out of three wrong supplements to give her! Sheesh! I think Amazon's supplement listing could really be improved. The nutritional label from the bottle should be printed on every page, so there's no mistaking what the item is. The clarity of the images needs a lot of improvement, also.I'm trying to give a neutral rating by assigning 3 stars.

Vitamin C absorption relies on an enzyme, we only produce enough of that enzyme to absorb 300-400 MG of vitamin C per day.  Several independent studies found plasma saturation occurs between 300 and 400 MG of oral Vitamin C per day, all you really need is a 500 MG supplement though a 1000 wont be harmful.  Once plasma saturation occurs any additional Vitamin C is excreted through urine and NOT used by the body.  The only way to absorb more than 300-400 MG per day is IV administration.  I wouldn't go the IV route, the human body has a limit to absorption for a reason and forcing more into your body after that is likely to cause unanticipated side effects.",5,,,

Been using them for about 2 years now. 3-5 per day (1 per hour or so) will reduce your sick days to 1 or 0 per year, add some missing vitality/energy and as a result, increase your quality of life. Reducing the daily annoyances helps you sleep better and feel more energized. The rose hips seem to prevent any stomach upset, too. I tried some other caps and capsules, but they didn't work well. The other caps were ineffective (Kirkland) and capsules release the C too quickly. One per day was the limit, or they would cause some stomach pain. Anyway, these Vit C with Rosehips are a must in your daily routine. When others are sick, you're not. It's that simple. Even the flu could pass you by (or symptoms are severely suppressed). That's my experience, anyway. When they go on sale, stock up. 3-5/day will last 2-3 months.",5,,,

The NOW C-1000 COMPLEX cost a couple dollars more but is buffered - i.e. less likely to cause stomach problem.Here's the description from NOW's web site about the ""Buffer"" feature: ""Calcium Ascorbate is not acidic and will not contribute to excess stomach acidity or irritation in sensitive persons.  Calcium Ascorbate is synthesized from a combination of Ascorbic Acid and Calcium Carbonate to form Calcium Ascorbate.""Also, some people would buy this, and then cut it in half, thinking that it's a better deal to buy the 1000mg pills. However, this will reduce or nullify the effect of the ""sustain release"". Moreover, there is no guarantee that the ingredients are equally divided between the two halfs. Unless the manufacturer put a ""cut line"" in the middle of the pill, it's a pretty good bet that the pill is not intended to be cut in half because the ingredients are probably not equally distributed within the one pill.For comparison shopping, since Amazon doesn't list the content, here is the Supplement Info for the C-1000 COMPLEX:Serving Size: 1 CapsuleAmount Per Serving:Vitamin C (from Calcium Ascorbate) 1.0 g (1,000 mg)  1667%Calcium (from Calcium Ascorbate) 110 mg  11%Citrus Bioflavonoids (37% total bioflavonoids as Hesperidin) 500 mgAcerola  50 mgRutin  50 mgOther Ingredients: Calcium Phosphate, Cellulose, Stearic Acid (vegetable source), Croscarmellose Sodium, Magnesium Stearate (vegetable source), Silica and Vegetable Coating.",5,,,

I'm poking it with a fork. still mostly undissolved.for years i've taken mega doses of vit c (2-8 grams a day). i have also used various brands. most of the time i use Now brand capsules. in general i think Now is a decent brand. but these tablets i'm suspicious of.the Now brand capsules dissolve fast in your mouth. i know this because i've popped them in my mouth a bit premature of getting water. very quickly you are left with a mouthful of granular vit c.on the other hand i took one of these tablets and left it in room temp water for an hour. after which it was still largely undissolved.at the same time i'm getting unusual flatulence.  this is not normal for me. my theory is the c is not fully dissolving in my stomach and small intestine. instead it makes it to the lower intestine and wreaks havoc. try and dissolve one of the tablets in water. i'm going back to the capsules.Update: 1/5/2020I decided I would make these into powder in a vitamix and dissolve into baking soda. this makes Sodium ascorbate. i've done this many times with ascorbic acid in granular form. at least i wouldn't be throwing out most of the bottle. reducing them to powder was easy...but the powder did not dissolve in water or combine well with sodium bicarbonate. i'm guessing this comes down to some of the fillers. bummer. i decided it was best to throw it all out and just get a pure ascorbic acid  with no fillers that dissolves easily. i then realized the capsules have the same fillers! time for a brand change.,3,,,

My boyfriend really enjoyed it and stated that he did feel energized after drinking it.  He will buy it in the future to help with immune support.  My grandad also was in love with airborne until I introduced him to Emergen-C and now he says he much prefers Emergen-C.  He thinks that it works just as well but tastes much better and I have to agree with him I tried airborne once and I couldn't manage to choke it down at all and that was before I was on my current medication.

Vitamin C,B00016RL9G,United States ,February 25,February,2015,-,yes,THE BEST,"*I did not purchase from this seller. My review is intended for informational purposes on my experience with Emergen-C*I LOVE this multi-vitamin packet. I can not take multi-vitamin tablets because they tend to upset my stomach, or some make me feel weird. I take this whenever I can. If I'm sick with a cold/sinuses, I take it. If I feel fine and remember, I take it. If my kids are getting stuffy, they take it. I am at work right now and got that mid-afternoon sleepy spell, so I drank a small cup of water of this and it woke me up without the jittery, or shaky coffee feeling. Plus, NO crash. I am sensitive to caffeine and this is perfect for a pick me up. The Vitamins make you feel good and are great for your body/immune system. You're getting a more natural boost. This was recommended by my doctor when I was sick with a bad cold a few years back. I prefer the Raspberry flavor and I like it dissolved in a small amount of water. I carry some in my purse with me in case I feel like I need one. They are great for after a night out of drinking as well!I recommend this vitamin pack to everyone, ESPECIALLY those who like Airborne. That stuff is awful and you have to take so much of it. This is a much easier commitment and tastes WAY better. I am happy this was recommended to me, since now I never not have any stocked in my kitchen!",5,,,

Vitamin C,B00016RL9G,United States ,January 29,January,2013,-,-,Every time I drink this ... I want to do a happy dance,Each packet contains 5 grams of sugar so I dont make this a daily habit even though it's so tempting. The fizz and genuine orange taste arerefreshing and it's a healthier alternative to orange soda. It does contain quercetin (component of real vitamin C) but no tannins so I'm not 100% sure about the efficacy. Nevertheless I highly recommend this as research shows 100 mg of vitamin C daily reduces lung cancer risk. Of course it's always better to get your vitamin C from real food instead of supplements but it's hard to find tasty oranges year round. The Chilean oranges I tried were a waste of $$$.

I have tried several flavors of Emergen-C and the super orange was one of my preferred. These fizzy drinks remind me of a sports drink, with a mild fruit flavor. They are not like juice, and are not like other sugary powder drinks. Emergen-C comes in many different flavors, and they even have hot drink options.

I was impressed with the B vitamins and other nutrients similar to energy drinks, without the caffeine, taurine, and niacin. I took Emergen-C before doing some physically intensive stuff like dirt biking and construction work. I definitely had good energy levels while working, which may have been attributed to the supplement.I tried Emergen-C in the month of May, which is when I usually get sick with some cold or flu. I was taking the supplement every few days. I've made it almost to the end of the month, and no sickness! It's definitely changed my mind on vitamin C supplements.The taste is pretty good. I was expecting it to be a terrible alka seltzer experience. But each flavor was distinct and it had just a tiny bit of sugar (5g) to make it taste decent. The fizzing is a little weird, though.

I'm not a fan of mixing it with just water, but I like putting the Raspberry in with juice and the Blueberry-Acai mixes well with vodka. Orange also tastes good with orange juice and pink lemonade is undetectable in pink lemonade - it really just boosts your drinks. And if you start drinking them as soon as you first notice any symptoms of sickness, it'll often kick them in the butt before they have a chance to really take hold. For the price, you also get a good amount of packets - way better than Airborne.I'm so glad I had a chance to try so many flavors from Smiley360.

Most of the time, I find a lesser length or strength of cold symptoms compared to those around me I have been exposed to.  While there is no way to necessarily prove the product makes this difference for me, I feel better anyway and figure the extra vitamins sure can't hurt.

Vitamin C,B00016RL9G,United States ,October 18,October,2014,-,-,High dose multivitamins with added sugar and bovine gelatine!,"Emergen-C's ""Energy Release and Immunity Support"" food supplement is a high dose (1000mg) Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid) plus multi-vitamin and mineral product. It is supplied in boxes of single-dose sachets of powder which rapidly dissolves in water to produce an orange-flavoured daily health drink, designed to give you a daily energy and vitamin boost.The product offers a dose of vitamins well in excess of the recommended daily amounts (Vitamins: C - 1250%; B1 - 136%; B2 - 121%; B6 - 429%; B12 - 720%; D - 200%) as well as fair top-up of minerals Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Manganese, Chromium and Zinc (the Calcium and Zinc being particularly important as mineral accompaniments to Ascorbic acid). It is flavoured with natural orange and lemon extract and coloured with additional E162 (Betanin, aka Beetroot Red) natural food dye. So far, so good.Where the product falls down in the health-giving stakes is in its massive sugar content: it contains large amounts of fructose, cane sugar and maltodextrin as sweeteners -- which explains the product's ""energy boosting"" claims. It also contains bovine gelatine as an entirely superfluous ingredient which immediately renders it unsuitable for vegetarians or vegans.  Be aware too that some people suffer reactions to Ascorbic acid in the form of swelling to the face, water retention or digestive disorders; no warnings about these potential (but uncommon) side effects are given on the packaging of this product.For those wanting a short-term high dose blast of Vitamin C and a general immune system boost to face down an impending winter cold, these powders are probably OK. To avoid the sugar they contain, though, it is probably better to opt for ""     Redoxon Double Action                       "" effervescent tablets instead, especially as these also offer a higher Zinc content (although these use Aspartame as the sweetener instead, which comes with its own problems). They do lack the additional vitamins, but it's probably also better to tailor vitamin and mineral supplementation to your diet and lifestyle than to take a single multi-mix. You might also wish to bear in mind that unless your immune system is taking a hit owing to an underlying health issue, it is generally regarded as undesirable to take regular large doses of Vitamin C over prolonged periods; they should be avoided altogether by anyone suffering from renal problems.",3,,,

When you get that feeling, start taking Zicam every 4-5 hours, along with one pack of EmergenC a day, and drink lots of water. Repeat this for two days tops. Once your cold hits, stop taking Zicam, and only the EmergenC and lots of water. If you should get a fever, take some Advil. I have done this for every cold for the past five years and my colds have not been bad at all. There were times that I didn't take Zicam in time and the colds were bad.That's my experience with EmergenC. Take what you will from that, but don't consider it professional medical advice.

Emergen-C provides more than enough of these essential nutrients to keep you going strong. Fortunately, the variety of flavors will keep you from getting tired of this product, especially since realistically it should be used daily. The makers of the product suggest 2-4 times a day but once a day should serve you well.This product is manufactured by Alacer Corporation, a company located in California. This company also produces several other immunity boosting products.Emergen-C can be purchased at most health food stores as well as your local pharmacies. It comes in two forms: a drink mix added to water and lozenges. The drink mixes come in 36 packs and retails for about $15.00. The lozenges come with fifteen in a pack and costs only about $3.00. The lozenges flavor is a lemon honey and is very tasty. You may not notice a boost in energy, but you will be protecting yourself by boosting your immunity during cold and flu season.I received a free sample of Emergen-C from Smiley360.",5,,,

I this product does not help prevent colds, or treat them, but it is nice to know that I am giving my immune system a little boost, which also makes me feel healthier overall.

Which is about as tasty as it sounds. That's not the case with Emergen-C. You get a 1000mg of Vitamin C, a little jolt of energy from 7 B-vitamins, 24 different nutrients, antioxidants and electrolytes, and a glass full of great flavors that range from super orange, raspberry, blueberry-acai, cranberry-pomegranate, pink lemonade...the flavors go on and on. Chances are, there's at least one for you! Did I mention they're fizzy, too? Yeah, they're fizzy. Score!As for the purported benefits, I can say that this is definitely a ""your mileage may vary"" situation, but I can tell you from experience that I rarely leave home without a glass of my Emergen-C. There's a lot of yucky germs floating around out there in crowded places like grocery stores, malls, and movie theaters. People coughing, sneezing, generally being unclean, snotty, germ factories. I will always welcome a little kick to my immune system before wading through all of that.I will say that I like mine with a little more water and sip throughout the day, where as hubby makes one small 8 oz. glass and chugs it. Weirdo. He loves the little kick he gets and the electrolytes and potassium for after strenuous activities.

I felt something coming on so I decided I'd try another flavor, I didn't really taste much of a difference, but did determine that I could mask the flavor a slight bit better by mixing them with a lemon lime soda. I'm not certain if they worked that well, but I didn't end up catching a cold if that's what was coming on.

So this is my third day and I will do it again this is the stuff is awsome as I'm sure any powder C would do the same but I believe you have to have 1000 mg per dose.

I have always recommended this to everyone that I know/knew. not anymore .I quote bekow in paranthesis from: (...)""The aspartic acid in Emergen-C can create a similar reaction to the aspartic acid in aspartame.Emergen-C® helps promote immune health, especially used as a prevention during cold and flu season. Each individual packet is a delicious fizzy drink mix that delivers 1,000 mg of vitamin C as ascorbic acid, as well as 24 nutrients with antioxidants, electrolytes and 7 B vitamins.I am not saying that Emergen-C is not a good product, but I can’t use it, unfortunately, and if you have ever had a reaction to the aspartic acid in aspartame, you may have a similar reaction to the aspartic acid in Emergen-C, like I did..Isolated aspartic acid can create blinding eye reactions.Aspartame is 40 percent aspartic acid, and I experienced severe vision reactions to it. After drinking a diet cola, I would develop bright squiggly lines in my line of vision, and the lines would grow to the point that I was temporarily blinded. Then, the bright light would disappear into my head and leave me with a screaming migraine.Once I realized that the aspartame in sugar-free diet colas was the source of this, I removed all aspartame from my life, and I never experienced another one of the squiggly line/migraine episodes. Until I started using Emergen-C, that is.Several months after my recovery from aspartame poisoning, I adopted a stellar wellness program. I was taking around 4,000 mg of ascorbic acid every day, and my friend who owned the local health food store suggested that I try the Emergen-C, which has 1,000 mg ascorbic acid in each packet.Gladly, I tried it, and bam – the bright, squiggly lines and migraines started up again. The migraines were not as bad as those caused by aspartame, but the squiggly lines were blinding.I went on the hunt to figure out what I had gotten into. I was disappointed to learn that it was the aspartic acid in the Emergen-C.Research shows that isolated aspartic acid can result in severe headaches.The research shows that isolated aspartic acid can negatively affect the brain and central nervous system. Well, I knew that was right!Aspartic acid, also known as aspartate, is considered a non-essential amino acid, which can be synthesized within the body. The problem comes from isolating the amino acid – this can be dangerous to your health.When I was researching aspartame toxicity for my book, 'Sweet Poison', I learned from the researchers that isolated amino acids (like the two found in aspartame) are loose cannons in the brain.Amino acids are supposed to remain in combination, as they are in nature. When amino acids are separated (isolated) in the lab, they lose their natural ability to work in synchronicity; one with the other, and can no longer “balance” one another out. Hence, they can become damaging to the brain, and toxic to the nervous system.""I am not the girl who cries wolf at all and did my research after first reading another amazon poster claiming this.",1,,,

The price on amazon for the Super Orange is cheaper than Wal- Mart (and saves me from going into a Wal-Mart...thank the Lord).  I also added this to my subscribe and save, so I get even more savings.I am a vegetarian and use this to get my B vitamins, which are particularly hard for vegetarians to get without supplementing.  I prefer the powder form as it is more readily absorbed.Super Orange is my favorite flavor; the others are too sweet for me.  I like to briefly warm about 6 oz of water and then add my 1-2 packs.  I feel that it dissolves better in slightly warm water.Vitamin C and B vitamins are water soluble.  If you ingest more than you need, you will just pee them out.  Although excessive Vitamin C can cause diarrhea, so be alert to that.  If you notice your pee is a bright yellow, you probably have taken in more B12 than you need.  This never happens to me so I know 1-2 packs per day is suitable for my needs.  In the past when I drank Red Bull, my pee would be a neon yellow, and fairly rapidly.  Interestingly, Red Bull provides 80% of your RDI for B12, while this product contains 417% leading me to suspect that the form of B12 in Red Bull is not readily absorbed.I have to add (since I am a dietitian and I couldn't write this review in good conscience without doing so) that I do not recommend using Red Bull for your pick-me-up.

Not to be too graphic, but your fluid output will turn an almost neon color when you no longer need the extra vitamin C.This is definitely a product that I keep on the shelf and it does not hurt to use an extra boost of C when you are going to be out in a crowd or traveling on an airplane.

I appreciated having this on hand to drink, however I don't feel like it kept me any healthier then if I had not drank it.  It is really hard to say if my colds went away any faster then without it.  As to the flavor, the Super Orange was my preferred flavor, but still not the easiest thing to drink all of.  I have a hard time putting into words exactly what it is that makes it hard to drink, as the flavor is not horrible at all.  I drink it because it helps to keep me healthier and combat those nasty school colds, not for a pleasurable drink.  I don't drink it every day, but will start it up once I feel that all too familiar tingle.  Good to keep on hand, especially if you gave little kiddos.",3,,,

This does have that in certain flavors like the orange, but some of the flavors are sooo good, I'm happy I found a new way to get a little extra boost in my day while also getting my vitamins.  My favorite flavors are the Pineapple Coconut and the Strawberry Kiwi. I definitely recommend getting this if you feel like your dragging your feet halfway through your day.

Oh my goodness; It made my oj taste amazing. I was shocked that I couldn't really tell there was anything extra in my juice. I got a sample of each flavor and played around with different fruit juices and I have to say that if you hate the taste in water definitely try it with juice.

Yuck.,"I started using Emergency-C back when it wasn't in the stores and could only be obtained directly from the manufacturer by ordering online. Back then it used mineral ascorbates in its formula, which is a far superior form of vitamin C. Somewhere along the line they made the switch to the cheaper and inferior ascorbate acid. I also noticed when reading the label today that there are 7 grams of sugar per packet. That's nearly two teaspoons!!! And what is worse the sugar is fructose.  It also contains corn syrup solids. Seriously, ewww!! I'm on a LCHF (low carb/high fat diet) and it is working wonders for me (13 lbs lost in less than 3 weeks so far) and my carb intake is very restricted (20 grams or less per day). I refuse to give up 8 of those grams to taking this product when those grams should be coming from fresh vegetables. So I made the switch to C-Salts Vitamin C Powder.  It is pure vitamin C, no sugar or other nasty ingredients and the vitamin C is from mineral ascorbates, not ascorbate acid.",1,,,

Vitamin C,B00016RL9G,United States ,May 27,May,2015,-,yes,This is NOT Vitamin C,"I was informed at a health food store - Amazing as it may sound if you’re hearing this for the first time, vitamins are more than the synthetic fractions we are commonly taught they are. The ascorbic acid you buy at the grocery store every few weeks, thinking you are buying Vitamin C, is just a CHEMICAL copy of naturally occurring ascorbic acid, which itself is still only a fraction of the actual Vitamin C. It is NOT Vitamin C.  Real vitamin C is part of something living, and as such, can impart life. Your synthetic, fractionated chemical ascorbic acid never grew in the ground, never saw the light of day, never was alive or part of anything alive. It’s a CHEMICAL a cornstarch derivative, a sulfuric acid by-product. In your body it’s just another DRUG. Synthetic vitamins have toxic effects from mega-doses and actually can increase the white blood cell count. Vitamins are only necessary in minute quantities on a daily basis. Whole food vitamins, by contrast, are not toxic since the vitamin is complexed in its integral working form, and requires nothing from the body, and triggers no immune response. If you want true vitamin C see a health food store, not a grocery store for Ascorbate. This is true vitamin C, not ascorbic acid.",2,,,

EmergenC brings back childhood memories, as it reminds me of a healthy version of those pop tablets.  Except EmergenC is full of healthy stuff, whereas the pop tablets were not.

Vitamin C,B00016RL9G,United States ,April 19,April,2016,yes,yes,The one supplement we feel we MUST always have!,"My family and I have been using this product consistently now for several years.  Long ago, I believed that the best way to obtain Vitamin C in our diet was through fresh fruit.  Then, in a college chemistry course, we had a lab requiring us to measure the amount of vitamin C in an orange.  I couldn't believe it- there was very little!  I had been spending a lot of money purchasing organic oranges to make my children fresh orange juice, thinking that even though it was terrifically hard on our budget, they were getting this important vitamin.  So, I briefly changed to solid supplements, until we had another lab and found that the binders used in some supplements are so effective at binding, that we couldn't dissolve them with HCl, or even sulfuric acid! Those binders were not going to give up the goods.  I didn't want to try to figure out which brands would actually provide the Vit C and which ones would simply ""pass through,"" so we started using this powdered Emergen-C.  We immediately felt a difference in energy.  First, I'll note that even though the Vitamin C is emphasized, there are more vitamins and minerals in each packet (see photo).  The company sells similar products with variations in content, so if this isn't quite right for you, try looking into those.  The dosage is listed as one packet daily; we each take two as this seems to be the right level for us, though the box warns not to exceed ""suggested use."" The directions state to mix it into a glass of water.  It dissolves readily with some stirring, without the need to heat it. I am too impatient to dissolve every last bit, so I usually drink down the small amount that didn't dissolve immediately. There is a bit of a ""fizz"" produced, so if you put it into a water bottle be aware that pressure will increase in a closed system and you may get some spray when you open it up.  The cardboard, glossy box is printed with vegetable-based inks, so when you are finished you can add it to your compost, vermicompost, or mushroom substrate.  The box is cleverly designed so that you can open it two different ways.  If you prefer to store it upright on the smallest side (perhaps to save space), then there is a pull-strip to open it up on the opposite small side, so that becomes the top of the box. The strip includes a tab to insert into the slot underneath so that you can close it again.  All of the envelopes inside are separate packages, so closing it is most helpful if you would happen the box over- it isn't needed to preserve the quality of the product.  There is another option provided to open it. One of the photos shows how it can be opened lengthwise.  On the long side, short edge there is a small arrowhead where it says ""push here to open.""  You could break a nail trying to do just that, it's best to lift from the nicely perforated curve just below that.  Then, you can open it as far as you want- just a bit to slide one envelope out at a time, crease the top if you want to open it part-way, or remove the whole top along the perforations to expose the 30 packets.  I like to open it all the way for the visual ""cue"" for my family to use them, just as the fruit & veggie bowl stays out to encourage healthy eating.  Each packet is well-sealed plastic and separately labeled with the ingredients, expiration date and lot number.  On the reverse side there is an orange arrow leading you to the small slit that allows you to easily open the packets without a scissors.  This individual packaging makes it easy to take these along in a purse or backpack, store in a drawer at work, or to slip one into a get-well card when someone who you know is a little under the weather.  I have never had one puncture or leak.  These plastic envelopes do end up in our trash, which I do not like, yet the packaging seems to be the best possible design.  The powder must be kept dry, so using paper envelopes would be risk the product quality and prevent taking these with us.  We separate our doses during the day, so the ability to take it along is important to us.  I suppose if they ever offer some with waxy paper envelopes, we'd use some of each type for home vs. taking on the go. The best value that we have ever found for this product is to include it in our regular subscriptions from Amazon.  We know we're going to use it, so it's convenient to have it show up just when we'd need some more.  If acid bothers your stomach, this product would offer you the option of complete control over the pacing of your dosage.  Otherwise, you'd need a buffered product.  All in all, I'd easily choose this as the only supplement my family and I couldn't live without.",5,,,

It mixes to make a lightly sweetened orange flavored drink with more vitamin C then you need in a day.  It mixes easily in cold water and makes me feel better- it takes less than 30 seconds to mix the powder and water.  It is one of the easiest things to make in my kitchen.  It might just be that I am a Floridan- and we tend to put a lot faith in the cure all properties of vitamin C- but I have never failed to feel better after drinking a glass of Emergen-C.I am reviewing this product in an effort to help other Amazon customers through relaying my experience with the product and providing any insight I garnered.

When we met, he told me of his years of suffering. After a little light research, I purchased Emergen-C because it addresses two out of the three problems that cause muscles cramps: not enough potassium and water. Every time he over uses his muscles and doesn't drink enough fluids, I mix up a packet and it prevents cramps. It also stops them once they start. When my husband had a very physically strenuous job, he would drink it on his morning and afternoon break. We always have a box around and he takes it when traveling. I hope they never stop making it.",5,,,

It replaces a lot of the good stuff that you lose when you drink alcohol (vitamins, electrolytes, etc.)  I certainly don't suggest relying on it for this reason, and do not endorse binge drinking, but if you find yourself feeling groggy, achy, and sort of empty from having a bit too much of the wrong kind of fun this will help get you through the day.",5,,,

Vitamin C,B00016RL9G,United States ,August 20,August,2014,yes,yes,1-2 per day has kept the Dr away for 2 years.,"OK I love Emergen-C for many reasons.1 - If nothing else they make drinking plain water seem less like a chore. Getting enough water on a daily basis can be tedious, but these packs actually give the water enough flavor that I get my 2 liters a day without having to force myself.2 - On average I drink about 1-2 of these per day for the last 2 years. I have not had a cold or been sick in those two years. Every winter of my adult life I have always gotten sick at least once. Living in NYC it is hard to avoid people who are sick, especially in winter on a crowded subway. Are these preventing me getting sick? I cannot say for sure, but I definitely believe they help a lot.  The evidence may be anecdotal, but my wife gets sick at least 2-3 times each winter and I do not.3 - I do Bikram Yoga (90 minutes of yoga in a room heat to 105 F and 70% humidity). You sweat a lot and by a lot I mean ridiculous amounts. These definitely help recovery before during and after. On average I take one in a liter bottle before a class. One in a liter bottle during class. One in a liter bottle after class. I've also done just plain water but my recovery with plain water is not as quick.For the price you cannot beat the value. It is a great help with getting enough daily water and provides essential vitamins. Just do it.",5,,,

I also bought a bottle of 100% orange juice (first time trying it out) got home and pour 1pkg. in a glass of OJ few hours later I was feeling better already.

When my husband started his chemo treatments, his taste buds changed and he needed some kind of flavoring added to his water, especially when he was on his 46-hour IV treatment at home. At the time, we didn't think about using Emergen-C and he used Crystal Light. This winter when we saw the two flavoring agents beside each other on the kitchen counter, it occurred to me that Emergen-C would not only flavor water but also offer Vitamins B & C, antioxidants, and electrolytes so I suggested that my husband try it in place of the Crystal Light. He loves it. He stretches a packet's flavoring throughout the day; (he only adds a little in each glass). We're going to try the pink lemonade flavor next.",5,,,

My friends who I shared this product with also fell in love with it, Unlike other vitamin c supplements, this has a wonderful taste and is not harsh on your stomach, no heart burn.

Vitamin C,B00016RL9G,United States ,June 21,June,2013,-,-,Great-tasting health booster!,"So I received a free sample of Emergen-C from Smiley360, and I was surprised at the effectiveness of one little package. It reminded me a lot of a crumbled Airborne tablet, where you just pour the powder and mix it with water (very little for a better taste). To be honest, I wasn't expecting much--after all, it's just vitamin c, right? But after a long workout, I was feeling a little unwell, and usually that bode well. Took a packet, and...nothing. Wasn't expecting it to rejuvenate me right away, but it did combat any sickness that I was expecting the next day. I know my body well enough, and had I not taken Emergen-C, I would've felt some ill effect the next day. This is a great preventer. If you feel a cold coming on, or even suspect it because those around you are coughing, take a packet--you won't regret it. However, don't bother with it once you're already sick. I turned my mom onto this, and she loves it too, but she made the mistake of waiting after she felt sick to take it one time, and it was already too late at that point. They offer so many different flavors, but my favorite is still Super Orange or Tangerine. I wasn't too crazy about the Tropical flavor--it tasted a little off to me--but would love to try the Dragon Fruit flavor (even though Dragon Fruit really doesn't taste like anything). Tip: Dissolve 1 packet with very little water for a better taste, and keep away from the dust kickup when mixing so you don't inhale it.",5,,,

The ad blurb above states ingredients all have but it does NOT list other ingredients that only some have. Super orange has only fructose as a sweetener and seems to me to be the most natural of all.

It used to be my favorite by far but the orange flavor is now pure chemical orange and there is a strong off flavor that distracts from the main flavor.  I'm giving it 2 stars only because the lemon-lime is definitely worse.I must admit that the super orange still produces the least fizz when mixing so you can mix a larger batch without overflowing the container with foam.The only flavor I can recommend now is the pink lemonade, which tastes good with no off flavor or aftertaste, though I hesitate to call it natural tasting.update: 6 Jan 2013My mom actually still had a bunch of the old formula emergen-C flavors.  The old super orange was fine - 3 stars.  The new super orange is really awful - 1 star.  The only difference I found in the ingredients on the packages was that the old one listed malic acid, orange juice powder, natural flavors.  The new one listed natural orange flavors, malic acid, orange juice powder.The new acai berry is still good - 3 stars.  The old black cherry heart health was very good - 4 stars - so I'll try the new one and report back in that product if the new one is also good.update: 2 Mar 2013The new black cherry was unusable.

I find that if you catch a cold JUST as it's starting to manifest the littlest of symptoms (ever so slight tickle in the throat) this will actually kick the virus to the curb.  If you wait beyond that however don't expect magic to happen as the virus has already set up camp in your throat.  It should however decrease severity but the only way to actually prove that would be to clone you at the time of virus onset and then have only one of you take EmergenC and see what happens.  We just don't have that technology so this does require a bit of faith.  I will take daily on every trip, small or large, sometimes twice daily if I am traveling with someone who is sick or am on a plane next to a coughing person.  Yes, some might argue that you are just 'peeing away your money' if you take more than one a day but I'm not sure how one can really know that it does or does not help.  With the price point of these, I really have no problem taking two a day and risk flushing my money down the drain.

My little girl started showing signs of having a cold a few days after I received my samples, so I took my friend's advice and drank Energen-C. The taste wasn't horrible, but I did have to drink it quickly through a straw to reduce tasting it. Even though I was exposed to plenty of my daughter's germs, I didn't develop any cold symptoms!

It's estimated 30% of the population can't properly use folic acid, so this really should be addressed, and more companies need to use real vitamins (derived from food) rather than synthetic versions. We've used this product for years, and I always wondered why it made me feel slightly queasy. Now I know! The synthetic additives are toxic to my body.

Funny thing.  The longer I practice medicine, the more I know is wrong.  I mean everthing seems to change year to year.  One year Vitamin A is a must, next year it's optional, and harmful to smokers.  One year coffee's good, another, bad.  Alcohol raises HDL, maybe not cardioprotective.  Vitamin C?  too much seems to push oxalates out of the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle in cellular metabolism which is excreted by the kidneys and makes kidney stones.  Maybe.  Depends whose study you read and in what journal, and who's funding them, and the prevailing attitudes of the peer reviewers (ABC?  Abortion = Breast Cancer is a lot like that too).  Vitamins?  Harvard just told us last year multivitamins help prevent cancer.  Couple months later NIH says nope.  Who are you going to believe?  Ivory tower knowitalls, government alphabet agency pinheads, or a random piece of information on the internet written under a Nom de Plume?Well, if you believe the internet information source, this is worth a try.

Vitamin C,B0061GLRN6,United States ,May 31,May,2020,yes,yes,Too large and no coating,"At 81 and having lost 1/2 of my household income because my hubby had a stroke one year ago and the rehab facility gets all of his income, I cannot afford to lose money on any product; thus I try to buy carefully. Even though this gruesome  vitamin was only $10.00, it can never be called a value for its money; given that you will likely have to throw the bottle away.I received it on May 21st and have been choking on it each morning. It was 100 tablets and that is a tremendous amount to discard but as soon as I find an easy to swallow replacement, this will be tossed. Until then, I must go through panic attacks every morning, fearing this is the time it will become jammed in my throat.It is too large and has little or no coating so that the minute it hits the tongue, the chalkiness starts adhering to the tongue and then no matter how much water you toss in your mouth, it won't easily go down.Worse yet, they are as hard as a brick and they are not scored, so cutting them in half is truly impossible. I have tried with a large sharp butcher knife, a large utility scissor and a serrated blade with which to score it myself. It cannot be cut in half.I will admit that I had esophageal cancer surgery in March so must be very careful in what I try to swallow but even had I had no surgery, I would have been unable to swallow these easily.Shame on these companies who see fit to make large, hard pills. There is little doubt it is not  necessary and then they do not warn you. I think all pills, capsules and tablets that cannot be seen should put the size under description. It is easy to do and would save the customer money and trouble. But, of course, that is likely why they do not. They would lose sales.",1,,,
Vitamin C,B0061GLRN6,United States ,July 29,July,2020,yes,-,Be Careful,Because of the pill shape these vitamin c pills get stuck in my throat every time I take them. They have a blunt end and vertical sides making them more challenging to swallow.,3,,,

When this happens,  I usually take around 5,000 milligrams of Vitamin C a day during the course of the illness.  I'm a firm believer in the healing power of Vitamin C and in the research Linus Pauling did so many years ago on the relationship between Vitamin C , in larger doses, healing inflammation of the body.

We find a significant difference in our general well being when we take 2000 mg per day. ""Vitamin C  is necessary for the growth, development and repair of all body tissues. It's involved in many body functions, including formation of collagen, absorption of iron, the immune system, wound healing, and the maintenance of cartilage, bones, and teeth.""I would definitely recommend it with one caveat. We are super clean eaters; therefore, very finicky about supplements. I am not a huge fan of stearates in my supplements. There is some controversy as to whether or not we should avoid it all-together if you do the research. Most of my other supplements and vitamins do not contain stearates, so I don't mind if on ocassion I find one that happens to have it, if the supplement is works and makes it worth while.",5,,,

I stopped taking them for a week to see if maybe my body had become immune and started doing 2 caps. a day again.

So I got the flu from her after she got the shot.  The exact same symptoms, very painful - beyond scratchy thought achy head and body - runny nose and sneezing.  It came on fast, but I started taking My Lyposomal-C packets which I keep at work and at home, and a few doses of Colloidal Silver which I get from Utopia Silver ( I did a lot of research and it's one of the best).  I took one Lyposomal every four hours as indicated if you are trying to fight something off, and I drank lots of water.  I went home early and went to bed.  And the next morning I got up feeling 90% better.  I realize I am a carrier still, so I am staying in my office and spraying down all shared touched surfaces with Chlorhexidine Gluconate  diluted with lots of water (the generic form of Hibiclens)  By doing this at work and getting my co-workers to do it too, we almost NEVER get sick.

It wasn't what I would say good tasting, but it did have a definite citrus taste and not 'bad'.  The label states that the contents will not dissolve in water, and that is very true. Since it is fairly dense/heavy, it will since like a rock to the bottom of your glass and even though you stir it feverishly it will not dissolve. So, you must drink it quickly once you have stirred it or it will fall right back down to the bottom of the glass.  I have to say that I was hoping to actually ""feel"" the effects of using this Vitamin C and I did not. I was taking the packets 3 times a day (because I know Vitamin C doesn't stay in your system very long).  I took it on an empty stomach each time, but I never felt anything.  Perhaps I didn't take them over a long enough period of time to see any results, but this stuff is too expensive to take very long ESPECIALLY if I don't feel any effects of it.  I had originally ordered the 30 packet box and went through that pretty quickly, so I ordered two boxes next time, just to make sure I was giving it long enough to show me any positive results.  I must admit that I am not suffering from anything in particular, so maybe I'm already healthy enough that I wouldn't realize any noticeable benefits.",4,,,

Made sure not to stir the gel like one of the reviews said. NO results. Absolutely NO CHANGE !Maybe I didn't try it for long enough? So I bought 60 more.I started to go with 2 packs a day. Did my energy level go up? Nope! Any miracle cure for my allergies? Not in the least. My rash on my leg? Still there.Complete waste of money buying this snake oil.

Also, I question if it is REALLY made in the USA, being that LivOn Labs website is just a sales only site with no details about the LAB.

I wasn't able to get the product until my flu was almost over, but I started feeling better within a day of taking the product.  I took between 2-4 grams a day.  After a week of sharing air space with my husband, I was really concerned he would catch it.  We're self employed, so no paid sick time.

Having a high fever in a hot country in a house with no air conditioning is not enjoyable! I was doing other things to clear it, but when I began taking this form of Vitamin C it made a huge difference. When I got back home I began buying it. I also have nerve issues, so I thought that having the phosphatidylcholine, which I'd been taught supports the nerve sheath, was a good idea too. I found that if I squeezed the open packet straight into my mouth and chased it with water quickly, the taste did not bother me and it just took a couple of seconds. Then I tried another brand, which comes in a bottle — so no landfill waste — and doesn't use any soy product (even though they claim it is not GMO, I generally avoid soy), but it tasted so awful and had to be mixed with other things to mask the taste and then you have things to wash which takes time, and I felt I had to refrigerate it so couldn't travel with it. I found I was not using it (I am a wimp when it comes to revulsion) so went back to these handy packets, which I can carry with me and don't mind taking and trust to work.",5,,,

Famed cardiologist dr thomas Levy was talking about it on ExtremeHealth radio podcast and said he had the flu and didnt have his IV c and took this and said five packets of it made him feel as good as getting an IV OF VITAMIN C ! That got my attention. I take several packets a day just to ward off normal toxins and take much more if i feel a cold coming on. Dr levy takes himself 5000 milligrams of NOW sodium ascorbate and 500” NOW ASCORBYL PALMITATE as the three different kinds work differently and effectivelly. Vit c is soooo important to take in high doses ... read and research it on you tube pidcasts of dr Hal Huggins and Dr thomas Levy and Linus Pauling ... educate yourself!

I am expecting miracles after listening to Mr. Thomas E. Levy on this product (he's a part owner of Livon Labs that produces this product, but seeing as Vitamin C is forbidden pretty much in every hospital in the US  as far as he knew as of May of 2015, I believe the video was dated, that is pretty much a bullet proof reason to believe it causes the body to be cured of things better than any pharmaceutical out there.  And of course as most know, doctors and others I suppose, have been getting miraculous results giving supposedly high doses (the fda mdr is about 0.00001 percent of the amount that can do any good (they're so sneaky...murderous is more the word but I do not want that on their conscience when they change their attitude, which they soon will believe it or not).  I'm a little nervous seeing xanthan gum and citric acid in it.  I'm about to look on YouTube about THAT.  Anyhoo, I'm forecasting miracles.  I am 62 this year and pretty healthy but take care of a couple people that could REEEEEEALY use some help that vitamin C is proven to give.  God I only hope they'll take it.  The husband will, I'm sure.  The wife who is in the depths of the medical establishment's medicating and diagnosing in a care home at age 60 or so, is the one that needs it most.  Maybe when she sees her husband (living with me between hospital stays for ODing pain meds) is recovering completely and off all meds, she'll get the picture !  Good luck to all.  We all so need this if it happens to be exactly what it is said to be: the best way to get vitamin C into the cells throughout the body !

However, we have tried to keep it on hand for the past few years, in the cold/flu season, and are very pleased with the results over-all.  In fact, for the month surrounding Thanksgiving and Christmas we take it on a daily basis.  Certainly worth a try, and it is good to take it at the first sign of a cold, if one hasn't been taking it in the days prior to that.

After reading multiple studies about combining Lypo-Spheric Vit. C and Pure MSM crystal I decided to give it a trail run.  I placed the vitamin c in a small mason jar with orange juice and shook it up well. He would drink it twice a day. I also used the Pure MSM crystals by mixing 1 teaspoon in a cup of purified water twice a day.

It resembles natural lecithin, so they mass produce it and sell it to food producers as a ""natural lecithin"" product.

Vitamin C,B0089EYWEE,United States ,February 7,February,2018,yes,yes,Miracle Drug That Works to Counter Common Cold and Flu,"This is my go-to weapon for fighting colds and flu. For example, I caught the common cold back in December 2017. It lasted for 6 days but all the symptoms (soar throat, sneeze, congestion and cough) were very mild. About two weeks ago, I caught the flu but it lasted for only 8 days. My temperature went to 103F but it dropped back down within 24 hours. I was coughing out brown phlegm, a possible symptom of pneumonia or bacteria bronchitis. The flu symptoms were more severe than the cold, but the whole episode lasted merely a week, a lot shorter than what flu typically lasts. It was no picnic though. Throughout the cold and flu, I took about 8 - 12 grams of Vitamin C daily for the first 3 - 4 days. As the symptom improves, I lower the dosage. The idea is to take as much Vitamin C as possible until the symptoms improve, or you start to have loose stool, then maintain that daily dosage level for the next few days. Your body is using the Vitamin C to fight the virus, something that anti-viral drug cannot do (anti-viral drug only stops the virus growth, but it does not kill the virus). My wife swears by this also. In addition to fighting flus, she says it helped her to control her shingle virus as well, dramatically reducing the pain (she said it was as painful as post surgical pain).What so special about this product is the way the vitamin C is packaged. The Vitamin C is encapsulated so the vitamin is absorbed by the cells more readily. Take the gel with an empty stomach so there is no digestive enzyme interfering with the delivery, and do not eat any food for at least 20 minutes.",5,,,

It is now mid January 2016 and I am happy to say not one of them has gotten a cold or flu let alone being hospitalized for double pneumonia as my uncle was last year.  He has Alpha 1 COPD so pneumonia is THAT much more serious for someone in his condition.  He has stayed healthy and strong this winter thus far and had an AMAZING recovery since he came out of two weeks in ICU in August/September 2015.  He has a rare disease, CIPD, in addition to the COPD, that caused his diaphragm to paralyze in late summer!  He was on a ventilator for one of the two weeks he was in ICU back in August into September of 2015.  He could only whisper when they removed the vent.  The doctors said his voice may never return. Well, it's back! And it's been back for a long time now!  My Grandmom (91 years old!) who had a chordoma tumor in her pituitary had it surgically removed in February 2015.  It came back so fast. :( She had gammaknife radiation in early August 2015.  Began the Lypo-Spheric C after she had gammaknife and has been doing very well since then.  She gets brain MRIs regularly.On a side note... beauty wise.... My grandmom and uncle have been taking the highest doses (2-4 packets a day) and I have noticed their skin looks incredible!I like to review products after they have proven the test of time. That being said, Myself, and 3 of my family members, have been using Lypo-Spheric Vita C for several months now. We all love it. It has helped my family immensely that had been experiencing significant health problems. Their health problems range from: Brain Cancer (chordoma brain tumor), COPD, CIPD, Dystonia, and Neuropathy.  Even though I personally live an organic holistic lifestyle for over 15 years, my family does not, and has numerous health struggles from living a ""mainstream"" lifestyle.  The point is, when people do not want to change their lifestyle, yet can take supplements that offer REAL results, without additional lifestyle changes, it is a highly impressive thing!  This is one of those products.I only take about 1 packet a day, and usually mix with other forms of vita c (including homemade liposomal C) throughout the day.My family with above mentioned health issues take 3-4 packets a day.  It has REALLY made a difference.We all consume them on an empty stomach.My family does not make homemade liposomal C (like I do) in addition to this product, nor have they made any additional lifestyle changes, but they are all reaping the benefits strictly through the packets from Livon Labs.",5,,,

The supplement at least 90% is made almost entirely out of Yeast or to be exact Saccharomyces Cerevisiae which is called Brewer's Yeast or Bakers Yeas please look up - Wikipedia to confirm this fact! I was told by Garden of Life Costumer service that they feed the yeast a natural high vitamin C rich food the Yeast then digest the nutrient eg in this case the Vitamin C so the yeast becomes Rich in Vitamin C content then they combine the now high Vitamin C Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Brewer's / Baker’s Yeast) with a complex base of mixed vegetable powder in order not to use fillers. Then the power mix is encapsulated. the problem is most people have a strong allergic reaction to Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Brewer's / Baker’s Yeast) ask most bakers who work around bakeries and bread making who are in frequent contact with Baker’s Yeast every day often all complain of contact dermatitis suggesting a large percentage of people have an acute allergic reaction to Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Brewer's / Baker’s Yeast) this type of supplement is nothing new or innovative this form of Yeast encapsulations has being around the Supplement industry since the 1980's remember high Selenium feed yeast supplements?

Vitamin C,B0098U0S8C,United States ,July 9,July,2018,-,yes,"Right after reading manufacturer's warning, I ended up at doctor's office","From the manufacturer's link on the box you can find an impressive overview of the product. I had already taken 2 of the capsules while reviewing the link. It was too late when I came across the product's warning: ""Caution: As with any dietary supplement, consult your healthcare practitioner before using this product, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, anticipate surgery, take medication on a regular basis or are otherwise under medical supervision."" I take a very low dose of a blood pressure medication daily under bi-annual medical supervision from a doctor. In a panic I stood up and screamed out,  ""What have I done?""With my heart racing, I called my doctor's office and they were able to work me in on what they said was a very busy day. I got to his office in less than 10 minutes using my emergency flashers and running red lights after first stopping and looking left, right, left for any oncoming traffic. The office receptionist saw me right away upon my arrival, but I had to wait and wait and wait. It was as if they didn't understand the caution from the manufacturer and what I did.  I paced back and forth in the waiting room, asking the front desk person how much longer every 5 minutes. I finally persuaded them to take me in front of a kid with the 103 fever (all he needed was some Tylenol).I showed the doctor the bottle from the ""Garden of Life Vitamin C"" and the manufacturer's caution I was able to pull-up on my phone. He asked me what else I had to eat or drink that day and I told him nothing. He appeared to study me while gently nodding his head up and down. It took him less than a minute to come up with a life saving solution for my irresponsible actions. He told me to put on an examination gown and then not to move, he would be right back. I ask him if he was going to get equipment to pump my stomach and he said, ""Don't worry, I will take care of you.""Ten minutes of what felt like an eternity had gone by and still no stomach pump. The interaction time with the vitamin C was increasing by every single second. Didn't he understand they just don't put warning precautions on labels for nothing. I jumped up to go find him and nicely remind him every single second counts in the 'Golden Hour'. I opened the exam room door and to my shock and horror he was standing outside of the exam room with 2 paramedics who had a stretcher. I was worse than I thought! The doctor so Kindly reassured me I was going to be alright, though. The paramedics were very nice as well, making sure I was very firmly secured to the stretcher so my arms wouldn't fall out in transit. I felt like I could breathe again, until the paramedics refused to put on the lights and siren to get me to the hospital stat.I was admitted to the hospital for observation, but there was no need to pump my stomach or start any kind of a chelation treatment on me. I believe they were concerned that my low dose of blood pressure medicine and the Garden of Life Vitamin C may have harmed my brain. They sent in what they called brain specialists to run a battery of tests on me using what seemed like just questions about everyday life. And no, I do not wet the bed! I am a grown man. After about 55 minutes of talking back and forth, the nice young doctors left and told me they were going to talk to the attending doctor. I took a deep swallow and ask them if I was going to be able to make it? They apparently didn't understand what I was asking when they answered yes. For the next three weeks I spent my days making little bird houses and other interesting things in what they called the arts and crafts room. The good things is I survived and lived to warn others of the potential dangers of mixing an all natural source of vitamin C with no GMOs, with a low dose of a blood pressure medicine. Now though, I have new meds to take in response to my vitamin C and BP med interaction and, I will have to be on them the rest of my life. I am just glad I lived through my ordeal and am able to warn others.",5,,,

You may be asking yourself, 'what is the big difference between vitamin C and ascorbic acid?'  A world of difference.  Not only is ANY form(L- and D-) of ascorbic acid synthetic and most likely made from GMO corn, it also lacks the ability to distinguish between good and bad gut flora(bacteria) because it lacks proper co-factors.""Ascorbic acid, the synthesized version of vitamin C, has been proven to kill bacteria effectively, which makes it effective in killing parasites and infections. Unfortunately, it does not differentiate between the good and bad bacteria in the gut, and wipes out good bacteria in the gut which is mandatory for vibrant health."" [...]Synthetic ascorbic acid is unable to kill scurvy, the hallmark of citrus fruit:""Whole food vitamin C as found in potatoes, onions, and citrus fruits is able to quickly cure any case of scurvy. By contrast, the fractionated chemical ascorbic acid has been shown to be insufficient in resolving a scurvy condition, simply because it does not act as a nutrient. (Lancet 1842)"" [...]Without these co-factors, ascorbic acid is just a cheap knock-off incapable of doing the real thing...  Worst part about this product is that they use deceptive advertising to make you think you are buying a product made purely from fruit/whole food sources when it is mostly ascorbic acid.

Vitamin C,B0098U0S8C,United States ,December 26,December,2014,-,yes,"""Isolates from food"" can't fool my body.","I emailed Garden of Life about the strange wording on the package. This is their detailed explanation:""Thank you for your email and interest in Garden of Life's products. This is to confirm that there is no ascorbic acid in our VC RAW Vitamin C. The Vitamins and Minerals that are in our Vitamin Code Products are in a whole-food form made with RAW Food-Created Nutrients. This process utilizes a single isolated vitamin or mineral (from food) that is fed to the yeast or probiotic. A specific peptide designed for that particular nutrient is then introduced in order to allow the nutrient to be metabolized (or absorbed) through the yeast's cell wall. This process mimics nature, just like when a plant takes an inorganic mineral salt that is naturally occurring in the soil (selenium for example), and absorbs it into its roots, the plant becomes rich in selenium. This process is conducted with two distinct organisms - S. cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and L. bulgaricus (probiotic culture used in traditional yogurt recipes which is non-dairy).Cultivated with their unique Code Factors intact, the RAW Food-Created Nutrients in Vitamin Code formulas enable natural recognition of nutrients by your body, just as nature intended. Code Factors are the known and yet to be discovered synergistic compounds found in food and are necessary for proper nutrient delivery. Providing these Code Factors infuses the essential elements of whole-foods that the body thrives upon.The Vitamin C is not coming from the Fruit and Vegetable Blend. That blend is added as a base to put the nutrients in to prevent us from using artificial fillers and binders.""Hope this helps. You have to read it carefully to see the meandering around the word ""synthetic."" And note that there is no mention of ""created enzymes"" that would tell our body what these vitamins are.  I highly doubt that this process makes any enzymes like tyrosinase at the centre of the vitamin C molecule.  I do find I get a good circulation effect with better colour to my face with about 8 capsules dumped in my water with lysine/proline. Real or synthetic C will do this by increasing oxygen.  But I also noticed nails splitting and chipping after a few days, which indicates minerals being leached (as synthetic C is a known chelator).  The nails returned to normal when I stopped the ""Raw C"" and switched to camu camu powder. I am also waiting for Megafood Daily C Protect to arrive.  It's from oranges, not synthetic ""isolates"" like GOL vitamin code.  They stated in their email the vitamins are ""isolates from food.""

Vitamin C,B0098U0S8C,United States ,April 10,April,2016,-,yes,I like this product,I like this product. A couple months ago I had a gum issue that distorted my face so I bought Vitamin C for its anti-infection properties along with charcoal pills and the problem went away in 4-5 days. So I stopped with the C and charcoal.  But I've had a sinus issue for over a year with a yellowish discharge from one nostril so I resumed taking this product in larger doses (6-9 a day) to see if it would help since yellow mucus is also supposed to be infection.  While the sinus/allergy issue still persists the nostril does not run nearly as much and when it does the mucus  runs clear so is the infection is clearing up. Trying to stay away from drugs/steroids which is what has been prescribed to my friends with similar issues. My only issue with this product is it contains garlic so I'd like to find something without garlic as I'm from that very small group of people who do not think garlic should be in your system on a regular basis. For emergencies yes but not day in day out.,4,,,

But these are great for the year round dust, dander or whatever is bothering me the other nine months out of the year.  Also, I've been taking Omegavia and I think the combination of the EPA fish oil and vitamin C is reducing my back pain since they are both anti-inflammatories.  I know they are expensive but it's worth the sacrifice.  I'm a healthy eater but I did not get this same effect drinking green juices or eating citrus daily.  These pills work.  Small disclaimer: Read the ingredient list. There's everything in here from strawberries to kale. I didn't read the fine print and I have an onion/garlic allergy, both are listed ingredients.

Its nothing like taking a standard Vitamin C pill, Emergencee or even eating an orange.  I don't know how they do it but they are instantly absorbed and they work great on reducing mucus.

Will go to my local nutrition store and pay more...I trust them.  To start, RAW Probiotics are grown in a state-of-the-art culturing facility. When the probiotics are fully grown, they are quickly put into frozen storage.  They are then packed in dry ice and shipped overnight in refrigerated trucks to our manufacturing plant, where they are immediately transferred to our own freezers for storage until they are ready to be blended and encapsulated. The facility we use is exclusively dedicated to the production of our probiotics. That means that Garden of Life controls the environmental conditions—keeping it cold and at the proper humidity.  After blending and encapsulating, the RAW Probiotics are immediately moved back into cold storage.  When retailers order Raw Probiotics, the finished goods are picked and placed into special insulated containers, along with desiccants (moisture absorbing agents) and frozen packs so that they remain at optimal temperature and relative humidity all the way to our retail partners.  Retailers are instructed to store the RAW Probiotics in refrigeration until the consumer purchases them and the instructions on the packaging inform the consumer the product is best when refrigerated. With Garden of Life's Arrive Alive system, you can feel sure that you are getting what the label promises.",3,,,

He has now been on it for about 4 months. His sores are fully healed, he does not smell at all, his dandruff is gone, he does not scratch or lick (more than normal) and his coat is soft, smooth and shiny. I am SO impressed!

I love all the Vitamin Code products and have switched to using them almost exclusively as I find them to be head and shoulders above other vitamins - I can tell my body really likes and absorbs them.  I have celiac and so have trouble digesting food and so supplementation is important to me.  I also don't eat much partly because I have digestive issues and lots of food allergies and partly because I like being really skinny but I just don't want the bad skin and hair, etc. that people like me sometimes suffer from so I'm really happy with these food-based vitamins that my body actually uses and absorbs and I don't just pee them out.  I actually see and feel a difference.That being said - I don't really notice a lot with this Vitamin C.  I'm not sure if I'll buy it again.  I definitely notice a difference in my hair, skin, energy levels, etc., with the Women's One a Day, Raw Zinc, Raw E, Raw D, Raw B Complex, and Raw Iron (as needed).  I don't particularly care for their Soil Based Organisms - I tried the Primal Defense and wasn't particularly impressed - I prefer Prescript Assist (or the much cheaper and almost as good Body Biotics Soil Based Organisms)  My boyfriend has had really good results with the Men's One a Day and the Raw B Complex and Men's Probiotics.So I'm definitely a fan of this brand - but just not every single product.

For reference, 20mg would fit on a pencil eraser.Unless the product says ""Vitamin C (from berries)"" or similar, than it is just plain old corn based ascorbic acid.Notice the only people saying it is not ascorbic acid are reviewers?

This is an isolated version of Vitamin C (just like 97% of the synthetic Vitamin C's they sell in stores). It's just that Garden of Life adds a worthless amount (20mg) of a organic proprietary 'Fruit & Veggies' Blend to make it seem full-complex which allows them to call it 'RAW.'This is the reason Garden of Life has launched their 'mykind Organics' line which actually tells you the source of each vitamin next to it in parentheses. If your wondering how you can tell on other brands whether they're organic/raw or not, look next to the Vitamin in the 'Supplement Facts' and if doesn't tell you what fruit it comes from in parentheses, it most likely isn't organic/raw. It should look similar to this: 'Vitamin C (from berries)'What makes this even worse is that we have no idea where the isolated vitamins they put in this product come from. Most Vitamin C that is on the market today is sourced from China and a lot of it is made from GMO corn...For something that isn't Raw, they make it seem that way by putting their 'RAW' logo everywhere on the front of the bottle. This clearly isn't a brand you should put your trust in. The product is merely an isolated vitamin that can be marketed as 'better' because has a 'little' (worthless) organic touch.",1,,,

It's made of pure raw vitamin from different kinds of berries and fruits and that's what makes it so powerful! I used to get colds or a flu sometimes throughout all seasons but in the last 3 years I was the healthiest me, thanks to this kind of Vitamin!",5,,,
Vitamin C,B0098U0S8C,United States ,July 8,July,2016,yes,yes,Best Vitamin C I have found!,"Vitamin C is an amazing vitamin.  Not only will high quantities of Vitamin C help the body fight colds and other illnesses, but it improves allergies.  When we kept bees, we learned a mega dose of Vitamin C would eliminate the swelling associated with bee stings or prevent swelling all together if taken right away.  Our bodies cannot manufacture Vitamin C.  We must get it from food or supplements.  From my reading about Vitamin C, we probably need much more than most people get.  The government recommendations are only based on what it takes to prevent scurvy rather than what it takes to be healthy in general.  These days the soil on most farms is so depleted that it is pretty much impossible to get the nutrition we need from food alone so supplements are a necessity for good health.  However, not all supplements are the same.  Many cheaper supplements contain synthetic vitamins our bodies cannot use.  Some Vitamin C is created from mold.  The best vitamins come from real food.  When I supplement, I prefer my supplements to come from food rather than a laboratory.  That is why I purchased the Garden of Life Vitamin Code Vitamin C, 120 Capsules.WHAT IS IN THE BOX:  One bottle of Vitamin Code Raw Vitamin C contains 120 vegan capsules.  Each capsule contains 500 mg whole food Vitamin C with Bioflavonoids.WHAT I LIKE:• This Vitamin C comes from real fruits and vegetables.• Probiotics and Enzymes are included in this formula.• Capsules are from a plant source.  Animal source gelatin often comes from factory farmed cattle.• This supplement comes in a glass bottle.  No plastic leaching horrible chemicals!• These are made in the USA.• Raw food is better than heated for vitamin content.  This Vitamin C comes from raw food sources.• Project Non-GMO verified.• Vitamin C from organic food sources.• Gluten and dairy free.• Capsules are easy to swallow.WHAT I DON’T LIKE:• There is nothing I do not like about this product.PICTURES:  I am including pictures of the bottle in my hand and some of the capsules in my hand as a size reference.I love this particular brand and form of Vitamin C.  I would whole heartedly recommend it!",5,,,

Since they actually don’t claim to be an immune booster I still give 3 stars because from what I can see they may help an otherwise healthy immune system stay healthy. I just had hoped they would be in place of immune boosters because they have the same punt of vitamin C.,3,,,

Taking ten at once would NOT be a good idea. Vitamin C leaves the system in a matter of hours so if you want the best results you need to take a couple at a time, a few hours apart. I've been taking large doses of vitamin C for the past 17 years. Maybe just luck but I haven't had even a common cold for over 17 years. I am not suggesting vitamin C will cure any existing condition other than scurvy. This terrible condition is a direct result of vitamin C deficiency. It takes very little vitamin C to prevent scurvy and most people get enough in their diet for that. I am a strong believer that larger than recommended doses of vitamin C can and does strengthen the immune system. I don't think any particular brand is superior to another. I chose this brand for the low price. I have not been disappointed.",5,,,

I can only say they work as well and the packaging is convenient.About rose hips - I have noticed that taking vitamin C buffered with rose hips gives me a sensitive stomach. Even stomach cramps.

Vitamin C,B07122C9VC,United States ,October 21,October,2020,yes,-,For our English Bulldog and Golden Retriever (6 months old),"We give these pills to our two 6 month old pups and they love them. They really help their immune system. Our retriever can swallow it with no problem, but we have to use a pill crusher for our English Bulldog, which is no big deal...it mixes right in with his food. We will continue buying this brand, as long as the quality and price remain the same.",5,,,
Vitamin C,B07122C9VC,United States ,January 30,January,2020,yes,-,Can cause joint pain.,We had been taking this about 1.5 weeks when it started causing knee pain to both my husband and myself. Since this was the only change we had made we researched it and joint and back problems were a side affect. We were hoping it would stop quickly but it hasn’t. Value wise it is excellent.

Avoid!!,"We took four of these per day for a two weeks and then our mouth and lips started to get very chapped and wouldn’t heal. Other small ailments appeared too. The only thing we changed in our vitamin regimen was switching to this brand “made in China.” Once we switched back to our regular ester C, our lips healed to normal within 18 hours. I highly recommend avoiding these bogus “supplements.”",1,,,

Vitamin C,B07122C9VC,United States ,December 5,December,2018,yes,yes,These do not contain gluten,"Wow, I didn't realize how many are in this bottle until I saw it. There really is six months worth of caplets here (if you take one a day).  And only one per day is needed...the 1,000mg provides 1,667% Daily Value. Fortunately, Vitamin C is excreted by the kidneys so any extra that's in your body is just eliminated. You will find that the caplets are a little on the bigger side, but they have a vegetable coating so I've found they don't get stuck in my throat when I swallow them. It is also wise to take them with food though, as the ascorbic acid may cause burning in your stomach.There is one review saying that these are not gluten free. I understand the concern, because so many people now are allegeric or sensitive to them. I researched it, and all of the ingredients in question (the fillers that make up the bulk of the caplets...everything except the ascorbic acid) MAY START OUT as a corn or wheat product, but the compounds that are extracted no longer contain gluten. I have that same concern and have been taking them for a few months now, without any adverse affects.These are definitely a great value (the best I've seen on Amazon), especially if you use the Subscribe and Save. I'll certainly purchase these again when I'm running low.The last thing I'd like to say about these is how I've felt since taking them. There was once when I felt a cold and a sore throat coming on. In combination with a zinc supplement it never progressed to the full blown stage. Actually, I've been taking both for several years now and haven't caught a cold or the flu (I also take precautions while I'm in public (I  wash my hands or use hand sanitizer after coming out of a store, other public space or a restroom.",5,,,
