### Detroit Open Data Visualization

We are asking anyone curious about City of Detroit data to send us a visual representation (chart, graph, map, infographic, etc.) of insights they garner through engaging our open datasets.  We will use one submission in our Annual Report, and the rest will be showcased on the City of Detroit Open Data Portal.
